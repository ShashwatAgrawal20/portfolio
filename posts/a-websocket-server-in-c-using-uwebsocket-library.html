                        We're not building another Todo app. We're not "moving
                        JSON from one box to another." We're building systems
                        that handle millions of concurrent connections, where
                        every nanosecond and every byte of RAM counts. We're
                        building the shit that financial exchanges, AAA game
                        servers, and high-frequency trading bots run on.

                        When you need that kind of raw, unadulterated,
                        "melt-your-CPU-in-a-good-way" performance, you don't
                        reach for a tool built for animating browser buttons.

                        isn't just fast – it's so fast it does encrypted TLS 1.3

                        unencrypted traffic. Read that again.

                        This isn't your typical "look ma, I made a server"
                        library. µWebSockets powers some of the biggest crypto
                        exchanges in the world, handling billions of USD in
                        trades every single day. When you trade crypto, there's
                        a good chance you're doing it through µWebSockets and
                        don't even know it.
